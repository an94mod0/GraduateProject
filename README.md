## Installation


```
npm install --save event-drops
```

Note you don't need this step if you don't use any module bundler.

Since version 1.0, `event-drops` follows [semantic versionning](https://semver.org/). Hence, we recommend checking your `package.json` file and ensure that `event-drops` version is preceded by a carret:

```sh
make install
make run
```
Demo will then be available on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
